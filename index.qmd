> Computers, as any programmer will tell you, are giant morons, not giant brains
> - Arthur Samuel

Thoughts, notes, experiments, and useful tidbits I find in my deep learning journey.

I'm Zander, a father, a learner, and ever-curious software engineer. I'm captivated by recent AI developments.
This blog aims to document my journey from zero to ML/deep learning practioner. 

Along the way I'll be sharing useful things I learn and publicly documenting of my work.
I'll also be making bad jokes. Hope you're okay with that.
