## Recap


## Quiz
1. How do you do gradient accumulation in fastai?
You divide the loss by the number of accumulation steps in your training loop and then you pass a callback to Learner that accumulates the gradients, using the desired effective batch size as an argument.
1. What is ensembling and how is it different with nueral networks vs random forests?
1. What is TTA?
1. What is k-fold cross validation? Is it better than doing straight ensembling?
1. How do you use it to get a better result from your test set?
1. What is cross entropy loss?
1. what is softmax?
1. Why can't you use MSE as a loss function when trying to create a classifier?
1. What is binary cross entropy loss? What case is it for?
1. Why is it that a multi-target model can have a higher accuracy than a single-target model, for the same data categorization task?
1. What is the last layer of most neural networks used for? What is are the activations of the last layer of a neural network?
1. What is an embedding and what is it used for?
1. What are latent factors? Why are they used?
1. Implment a basic dot product model in PyTorch.
1. How can you use a sigmoid to create a range of predictions?
1. What is the use of the bias in a dot product model? Explain conceptually and mathematically.
1. What is another name for weight decay? What does weight decay do?
1. Why do we use it? What is the equation for it?
1. What is weight decay balancing?
1. What is regularization?
