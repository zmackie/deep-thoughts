    "text": "This lesson was all about getting a model deployed to production. It was an occasion for me to make sure I had jupyter working locally and to understand how that flow would work. I used Jeremy‚Äôs technique of having an app in notebook and exporting it with dbdev directives, which I thought was pretty valuable as a workflow. I also set myself up on paperspace, which is great!\nThis lesson‚Äôs clean notebook was basically a recap of lesson 1, with bears instead of cats and dogs or birds.\nI deployed my model to a Huggingface Space using Gradio. This is based on a model I trained last week for recognized bean lesions. So if you happen to be a farmer wanting to evaluated the health of your beans‚Ä¶you know who to call üò∏. I skipped the step of using the api for this app. Gradio now has an API client that has to be installed with npm. Which‚Ä¶Im not trying to deploy anything that needs a build step. I wish they hadn‚Äôt done that‚Ä¶\nI hit a few hiccups which were easily navigated with some googling. Mainly these were API changes in various libraries. Inevitable as things move along but bumps nonetheless.\n\n\n\nProvide an example of where the bear classification model might work poorly in production, due to structural or style differences in the training data. Not great at images that differ in stylisitically. The camera to recognize the bears might be mounted upside down.\nWhere do text models currently have a major deficiency? They‚Äôre plausible, but are they correct?!\nWhat are possible negative societal implications of text generation models? Spreading false information that‚Äôs very convincing\nIn situations where a model might make mistakes, and those mistakes could be harmful, what is a good alternative to automating a process? Human in the loop.\nWhat kind of tabular data is deep learning particularly good at? where the column data might be very diverse\nWhat‚Äôs a key downside of directly using a deep learning model for recommendation systems? The recommendations might not actually be helpful. eg. they might recommend books you already have\nWhat are the steps of the Drivetrain Approach? objectives, levers, data, model (how the levers influence the objectives)\nHow do the steps of the Drivetrain Approach map to a recommendation system? objective: drive more sales levers: ranking of the recommendations data: past choices of the user model: two models that are contingent on seeing or not seeing the recommendation\nCreate an image recognition model using data you curate, and deploy it on the web.\nWhat is DataLoaders? Generic class for getting data into a learner\nWhat four things do we need to tell fastai to create DataLoaders?\ninput and output types\nhow get get the items\nhow to label the items\nhow to create a validaton set\nWhat does the splitter parameter to DataBlock do? telling fai how to split of a validation set\nHow do we ensure a random split always gives the same validation set? seed will set the randomness\nWhat letters are often used to signify the independent and dependent variables? x for independent y for dependent\nWhat‚Äôs the difference between the crop, pad, and squish resize approaches? When might you choose one over the others? crop = cut pad = fill in with black squish = distort to fit chose might be dictated by the particulars of the data\nWhat is data augmentation? Why is it needed? creating random variations that seem different (to a model) but don‚Äôt actually change in meaning\nWhat is the difference between item_tfms and batch_tfms? item is single, batch is a group\nWhat is a confusion matrix? a nXn matrix that plots what the model was predicted vs the correct labels. the center diagonal is correct guess. others a re off somehow. lets us see issues in data or model. uses the validation set.\nWhat does export save? a pkl file of the trained model\nWhat is it called when we use a model for getting predictions, instead of training? inference\nWhat are IPython widgets?\nWhen might you want to use CPU for deployment?

    "text": "This week was basically an intro and some quick examples of using the fastai library in a variety of contexts. Most of the initial demonstration comes in the form of computer vision.\nI ran through the clean notebook on Kaggle.

How would you describe the steps of this process? ‚Äúcomputers are giant morons, not giant brains‚Äù\nWhat did Samuel mean by ‚Äúweight assignment‚Äù? weight assignments are the value of variables (weights) that are part of the input to our ML program. they affect its operation.\nWhat term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called ‚Äúweights‚Äù? parameters\nDraw a picture that summarizes Samuel‚Äôs view of a machine learning model. \nWhy is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?

No.¬†For example in time series we can‚Äôt just randomly select points as they won‚Äôt make sense for the input. we would set aside a validation set thats a portion of the timeline.\nWhat is overfitting? Provide an example. When a model is trained for a long time on data, it can learn to recognize the exact data in the training set and not generalize. For example it would recognize all the individual cats, but not generalze to a new cat.\nWhat is a metric? How does it differ from ‚Äúloss‚Äù? an indication of performance of the model against the validation data. loss can be the same, but it might differ in order to be useful as a function to update the parameters/weights\nHow can pretrained models help? Taking a model where there are existing layers that can do something and specializign the last layer(s) to our specific task.
